[00:00:20.165] Server  ERROR   React does not recognize the `xmlnsXhtml` prop on a DOM element. If you intentionally want it to appear in the DOM as a custom attribute, spell it as lowercase `xmlnsxhtml` instead. If you accidentally passed it from a parent component, remove it from the DOM element.

[00:00:21.915] Browser ERROR   A tree hydrated but some attributes of the server rendered HTML didn't match the client properties. This won't be patched up. This can happen if a SSR-ed Client Component used:

- A server/client branch `if (typeof window !== 'undefined')`.
- Variable input such as `Date.now()` or `Math.random()` which changes each time it's called.
- Date formatting in a user's locale which doesn't match the server.
- External changing data without sending a snapshot of it along with the HTML.
- Invalid HTML tag nesting.

It can also happen if the client has a browser extension installed which messes with the HTML before React loaded.
